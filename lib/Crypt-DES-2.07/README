Crypt::DES - an XS-based DES implimentation for Perl.

The 2.XX tree represents a major improvement over the
1.XX tree. This package builds on big-endian
machines and many more x86 platforms than before.
(with a few rare exceptions, like gcc on DUX against
5.004).

mod_ssl conflicts have also been resolved.  Thank you 
to Jan 'Kozo' Vajda for pointing out the des_SPtrans
overlap between these two packages.

In release 2.04, des.h was renamed to _des.h in an
attempt to solve the build-on-Solaris problem.  Reports
would be appreciated.

In release 2.05, all references to des_ were changed to
_des_ since the 2.04 release didn't seem to fix the problem
on Solaris.

In release 2.06, SvUPGRADE was changed to a statement.

In release 2.07, a minor bug in META.yml was fixed.

Prerequisites
-------------

For the full test suite to run, Crypt::CBC, version 1.22 or higher
is required (recommended is 1.25 or higher), however this module
is not mandatory for standalone DES use, and all other tests
will run to completion. 

Installing Crypt::DES
---------------------

nothing unusual:

        1. perl Makefile.PL
        2. make
        3. make test
        4. make install

Notes
-----

The following is a list of known good platforms:
FreeBSD 3.5-RELEASE / x86 / 5.005
OpenBSD 2.7 / x86 / 5.6
Linux / x86 / 5.005 & 5.6
Linux / PPC / 5.005 & 5.6
Solaris7 / SPARC / 5.005
Solaris / x86 / 5.005
DUX / Alpha / 5.005 (using DEC cc)
Win32 / x86 / 5.005 (using VC++5)
OS/2 / x86 / 5.6

Reports of builds against 5.004 have been equally
positive.  Building on Win32 with VC++6 may prove
problematic.  Complaints about build problems on
Win32 will be sent to /dev/null.

Please report any other successful OS/Platform 
combinations to amused@pobox.com.  Thank you.
